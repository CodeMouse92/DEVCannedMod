# `#cpp` Tag Adjustments

## Mis-tag: Objective C (#objectivec)

I think you were looking for the `objectivec` tag (for Objective C), not `cpp` (for C++), which is a different language.

## Mis-tag: C# (#csharp)

I think you were looking for the `csharp` tag (for C#), not `cpp` (for C++), which is a different language. (P.S. Tags don't support non-alphanumeric characters.)

## Irrelevant

Articles and discussions should be directly related to the C++ programming language.
