# `#productivity` Tag Adjustments

## Should be a Listing

We have a separate area for such offers: [listings](https://dev.to/listings).
Please check them out and convert this post to a listing.

Here are some more details how listings work and what they are aimed for:

Thank you

## Mis-tag: #news

Announcements and updates about productivity tools, services and updates to such should use the [`#news`](https://dev.to/t/news) tag and/or [Listings](https://dev.to/listings) instead. From posts with the tag `#productivity` we expect tips on how to use tools and software, process optimization, useful references, experience, and mindstate optimization.
Productivity is a very broad term with many aspects and topics. From the color design of the office to personal rituals, anything can contribute to increase / optimize your own productivity or that of a team.

## Mis-tag: #showdev + #devjournal

Showing off something you've built belongs in the [`#showdev`](https://dev.to/t/showdev) tag. Since you're describing your journey to building it, [`#devjournal`](https://dev.to/t/devjournal) may also be a good fit. From posts with the tag `#productivity` we expect tips on how to use tools and software, process optimization, useful references, experience, and mindstate optimization.

## Mis-tag: DEV Journal, personal records (#devjournal)

We went through the posts of the `#productivity` tag and refined the expectations the community has for this tag.
We expect something like "Why should I write a bulletjournal / devjournal to be more productive" instead of the actual journal.
We removed the tag `#productivity`.
Please use the tag [#devjournal](https://dev.to/t/devjournal) for this and following related posts :)
Thanks.

## Roundup

"Roundups" or other lists of tools or articles regarding productivity should now use the appropriate technology tags instead. From posts with the tag `#productivity` we expect tips on how to use tools and software, process optimization, useful references, experience, and mindstate optimization.
