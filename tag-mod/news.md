# `#news` Tag Adjustments

## Should be a Listing

We have a separate area for such offers: [listings](https://dev.to/listings).
Please check them out and convert this post to a listing.

Here are some more details how listings work and what they are aimed for:

Thank you

## Mis-tag: #showdev + #devjournal

Personal successes, promotions, job changes, and completed projects are gladly appreciated and admired! Other tags like `#devjournal` are perfect for this, but not `#news`.
When to use the tag `#news`:

-   new service or product launched
-   service, product, framework, library or language itself got updated (brief summary must be included as well as the source)
-   the announcement could be of interest to more than just yourself.

When not to use it:

-   political posts
-   news from media
-   to promote people
-   to talk about personal goals (for example "I started to meditate every morning to increase my productivity" is nothing for this tag).

You can rewrite your post and request for the tag to be added again, if you want to.
Feel free to reach out to us and share your thoughts.

## Promotional only

Posts here on DEV.to should contain actual substantial content, not just be intended to promote another external work. From the Terms of Use:

> Users must make a good-faith effort to share content that is...not designed primarily for the purposes of promotion or creating backlinks. Additionally, posts must contain substantial content — they may not merely reference an external link that contains the full post.

## Linkback only post

Hey there, can you share this in full on DEV?
We encourage the entire article to be published on DEV.to (if you have proper rights), with a linkback if appropriate.

Hope you'll consider sharing the full post going forward.
