# Contributing

If you want to add a canned response, or revise one that's already present, please use **Pull Requests** instead of Issues whenever possible.

## Pull Requests

* All canned responses must follow the DEV [Code of Conduct](https://dev.to/code-of-conduct), as well as any policies and practices outlined in the [Comunity Moderation Guide](https://dev.to/community-moderation) and [Tag Moderation Guide](https://dev.to/tag-moderation).

* Ensure any responses are added to the appropriate directories and files, following the repository structure outlined in `README.md`.

* Files should follow this format:

```text
# Response Category (e.g. `#beginners` Tag Adjustments)

## Response Purpose

The canned response belongs here, using DEV's flavor of Markdown. Use only soft wrapping!

## Another Response Purpose

The next canned response belongs here.

## Yet Another Response Purpose

Tag names should be wrapped in backticks `#likethis`, and link to the tag if possible.
```

## Issues

Issues should be used for anything that warrants a proper discussion, instead of just an immediate change. This includes:

* Broad adjustments to tone or policy that will affect multiple existant responses.
* Changes to repository structure.

Most of the time, it's easier just to make a Pull Request and AFNP (Ask Forgiveness Not Permission). ;)

***Please do not use Issues for minor fixes, such as typos;*** create a Pull Request for those situations instead.
