# Contributing

If you want to add a canned response, or revise one that's already present, please use **Pull Requests** instead of Issues whenever possible.

## Pull Requests

All canned responses must follow the DEV [Code of Conduct](https://dev.to/code-of-conduct), as well as any policies and practices outlined in the [Comunity Moderation Guide](https://dev.to/community-moderation) and [Tag Moderation Guide](https://dev.to/tag-moderation).

Ensure any responses are added to the appropriate directories and files, following the repository structure outlined in `README.md`.

Files should follow this format:

```
# Response Category (e.g. #BEGINNERS TAG ADJUSTMENTS)

## Response Purpose

The canned response belongs here, using DEV's flavor of Markdown.

## Reponse Purpose

The next canned response belongs here. Tag names should be wrapped in backticks `#likethis`.
```
