# Promotional Posts

NOTE: Moderators should aim to only use these once per author. If an author
violates site policy multiple times after an initial warning, use the
appropriate downvote or reporting actions instead.

## Linkback Only

We encourage the entire article to be published on DEV.to (if you have proper rights), with a linkback if appropriate. Otherwise, we recommend original material, such as an original commentary on the article. From the [Terms of Use](https://dev.to/terms):

> Users must make a good-faith effort to share content that is...not designed primarily for the purposes of promotion or creating backlinks. Additionally, posts must contain substantial content — they may not merely reference an external link that contains the full post.

Posts that are simply intended to encourage readers to view an external resource are discouraged.

Thank you.

## Promotional Only

Posts here on DEV.to should contain actual substantial content, not just be intended to promote another external work. From the [Terms of Use](https://dev.to/terms):

> Users must make a good-faith effort to share content that is...not designed primarily for the purposes of promotion or creating backlinks. Additionally, posts must contain substantial content — they may not merely reference an external link that contains the full post.

However, [DEV Listings](https://dev.to/listings) may be appropriate for this.
(See the rules there.)

Thank you.

## Advertising

Posts here on DEV.to should contain actual substantial content, not just be intended to promote a company or service. From the [Terms of Use](https://dev.to/terms):

> Users must make a good-faith effort to share content that is...not designed primarily for the purposes of promotion or creating backlinks.

Posts that are simply intended as advertisements are discouraged.

Thank you.

## Job Posting

Hey there!

Submitting a job offering as an article isn't ideal as folks are generally expecting to read full posts with some actionable info or discourse (i.e. tutorials, editorials, tool lists ,etc).

However, [DEV Listings](https://dev.to/listings) is perfect for this. Consider sharing your sharing job Listings here - dev.to/listings/jobs and perhaps you'll have better luck. Also, you might want to check out - dev.to/listings/forhire for potential candidates to reach out to.

Hope this helps!

## Requesting Work/Project

Please use [listings](https://dev.to/listings) for posts requesting projects or work. Thank you.

## NFT promotion

It would be better if you share this on [MetaPunk](https://www.metapunk.to/), part of the Forem network of communities, dedicated to this topic - there's no coding content to this post, so it is less suitable for DEV.
