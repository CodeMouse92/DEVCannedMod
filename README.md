## Purpose

Community and Tag Moderators on DEV often encounter the same sorts of situations over and over. Canned responses make our jobs a lot easier, especially when it comes to adding and removing tags, or addressing common situations in comments.

I started keeping a file of my canned reponses, eventually migrating it to Gist for easier access, and to help out other tag moderators on DEV. The only trouble was, I was the only one who could really edit it. Not very useful for everyone else!

This repository is an attempt to collect all the best canned moderation responses into one repository. This is the continuation of [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/CodeMouse92/97f92e12dfa6d766069ad0ccb87e827c). By using a repository, not only is the history of the comments more easily tracked, but other moderators can also suggest revisions and add their own comments.

## Repository Structure

The `community` directory contains files that correspond to common scenarios, such as `community/promotional.md`. Tag *suggestion* comments (versus adjustment messages) are also here.

The `tag-mod` directory is for tag adjustment responses. It contains files that correspond to DEV tags. For example, canned responses for tag adjustments on the `#beginners` tag are in `tag-mod/beginners.md`.

## Usage

Copy-and-paste the Markdown source code for whatever response you want to use. **You are encouraged to adapt it to the particular situation as appropriate,** although you may use it as-is if you see fit.

**REMEMBER: Canned responses are not a replacement for real interaction.**
